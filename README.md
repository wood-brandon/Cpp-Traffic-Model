# Cpp-Traffic-Model
An OOP based traffic model system created using C++. 

This system can be used to simulate traffic, with cars moving forwards each 'tick' of the simulation, or performing a left/right turn. If the move is invalid, they will either go straight or do nothing as you would expect. All of the cars are stored in a platoon class, which is a linked list responsible for add/removal semantics.
